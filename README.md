# Instructions

1. Create a Python module called "passwords". 
2. The module should have at least one function responsible for generating a random password. The base for the function is available at the file `skeleton.py`. You are free to use any programming style or organize the module the way you want. Third-party libraries are not allowed, only builtins.
3. Use the function you have created to generate 12 passwords, 3 for each complexity level where you should use as `length`, respectively: 8, 10 and 12 characters. Create a script to store the 12 generated passwords into a file (you can choose the file type).
4. Using the `check_password_level` function from `skeleton.py` as base create a test function the return the level of complexity for a given password.
5. Create a script that read the file you generated on step 3 and store the output for each password into a file (you can choose the file type).
6. Compress all files (Python scripts and generated output files) into a single `test.zip`.
7. Write an email to me explaining your solution and why did you coded it the way you coded and attach the `test.zip` file.

Consider all code written here as a production code.
